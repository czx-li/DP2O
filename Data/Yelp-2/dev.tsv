Yuuummmm. Typically, I enjoy going to little hole in the wall Mexican restaurants and tacos stands... This is the only non-authentic Mexican place I've ever been to that could hold it's own (when it comes to tacos at least). Their street tacos were so tasty!\n\nAtmosphere was a little off though... Just one bartender/waitress serving half of the people in the restaurant.	1
Good times to be found here if you love Rockabilly music. I'll definitely be be back here soon!	1
Solid service in this hidden on the strip Thai place. Ambience and quiet are the highlights here. Food was pretty good. I chose the cashew chicken which didn't seem real spicy at level 5. I'll likely come back due to location and room noise isn't high which is rare on the strip. Lol.	1
its a bit pricey but very good food! I highly recommend this place!	1
Really cool place to hang out and/or to study because it's open 24hours and has comfortable seating area and good snacks! I used to spend so much time here back in the days :)	1
Yummy! Best Ive had.	1
Absolutely the best ice cream around. I stopped into the shop on a lazy Sunday after hearing so many Twitter about this place. I tried both the Salted Butter Caramel & the Almond Toffee Crunch. Both were amazing. I have yet to try the Sorbet but I can attest to the fact that the ice cream is the best in the Valley.	1
Excellent caring staff, great work, and fair fees. Dr. Stavoe is personable and professional and the hygienist Joanne is the best. Kirsten in the front office is fantastic to work finances with. The overall feeling in this office is light and happy -  I've finally found a dental office I am very happy with.	1
Best. Meal. Of. My. Life.\n\nI only give Shibuya four stars because of the price, but - let's be honest - it is worth it and then some. The ambiance and service was top notch, but the meal was - hands down - the best of my life. My friends and I were audibly moaning with pleasure. It was borderline inappropriate how much we loved our meal and I'm sure our neighbors were wishing they had chosen another table.\n\nYes, Shibuya is pricey, but try the tasting menu and die happy.	1
Stratta has some of the most amazing Italian food i've ever tasted. They have this mushroom Pizza with truffle oil that will melt your mouth and your heart. The wine selection is quite good as well. The ambiance is nice, not my all time favorite but definitely good and worth the trip for the impeccable service and food. I have tried most things on their menu as I have eaten there on several occasions and there is nothing I would steer you away from . BUT, I would strongly urge you to try anything on their menu that offers truffle oil! Which isn't hard since most things have truffle oil offered.	1
this show is more of a play than a comedy show, that said dont be scared off from seeing a play. setup is there are three comics entertaining each other between sets. sort of a back stage view of what you dont see at a comedy club. have seen performers at other venues in town, was great. go in expecting to hear some jokes at a late night show. the performers are good, the jokes are funny and the venue is smallish (is that a word) and intimate. for me the show worked.	1
Love the food, the help is very nice, I had the wonton noodles and the ribeye buns...they both fantastic and I can't wait to try more dishes!	1
I called and was able to get a same day appointment with Amelia. She did my Brazilian and it was so fast and easy...I think I was done in 15minutes. She didn't try and sell me anything just made some suggestions....I will be back.	1
Great, unique burgers.  Who would have thought cucumbers would taste good on a burger?  Fries were decent--I'd try plain next time. No beer or wine.  About three miles from the Musical Instrument Museum.	1
Honey Pig is good, recommended to my by a good Korean/American friend.  I've been twice, both times around lunch time, and we did the AYCE lunch.  \n\nI thought the food was good and the service was good as well...but it wasn't busy at that time so it wasn't a problem.  \n\nBased off my experience I would go there again, but may check out some of the other Korean places with high reviews here on yelp.	1
So I went there again on their Burger and Bourbon Night. The burger was so freaken good, it had a perfect blend of mild spices, and topped with a melted smoked mozzarella. The fries were great, a White Truffle Oil with a Garlic Lemon Aioli. And the drinks are perfect. I always get a French 75 and the bartender makes it very well. Charlie, the bartender/ server is extremely nice and very much a mans man, and very handsome! Men would enjoy the surroundings and the drinks. Great for business and hanging out. Women would love it for Charlie, Women Wednesdays and the great foods.	1
Do not get oil change here!!! They are not well trained and will put your filter on wrong and will leave out a couple parts which will cause you to take it to a REAL place to get it fixed for ten times what you spent on an oil change! And then you will ask to speak to a manager and they will never call you back even if you try repetitively to get ahold of a manager. Then when you do finally get ahold of them they tell you that you should've came back there to fix it and they are not responsible for the work you had done elsewhere! Rediculous freddys is what they should be called. Done with them.	0
US Airways lost my carry on luggage in Charlotte which I checked, as a courtesy to them, after they went on the loud speaker asking for volunteers to check luggage because of such a full flight. I waited 90-minutes and they were not even apologetic. There were quite a number of poor consumer at their baggage counter experiencing the same. And this flight was contracted by American Airlines. I will NEVER AGAIN KNOWINGLY SPEND MY MONEY TO BOOK A FLIGHT ON US AIRWAYS!	0
Yikes! This is my first and last time here. It's obvious that no one has put a dime into this esstablishment in years. Everything down to the chairs and bar counter are old and worn. \n\nI can't comment on the food, but the bar selection seems decent although I'm sipping on an awful pinot noir at the moment.\n\nI will not be returning.\n\n1 star for cost\n1 star for being located in the Steel Building	0
Got a coupon in the mail for a $5 haircut, let's just say I got what I paid for.\n\nI just needed a very quick, very basic clean up. I haven't had a haircut disaster in literally a decade. She came in with all her own recommendations and I came out looking like Ellen Degeneres*.\n\n*Ellen's great and all, but I don't want her hair!	0
Reached out to corporate. They sent me a coupon. Wait is still ridiculously long.	0
Service wasn't that great. The prime rib has no flavor. The portions were smaller than you would get at a French restaurant. Dessert looked decent but it looked better than it tastes.	0
This would be the perfect place to see a bunch of old broads crowing about the Sex and The City movie, comparing themselves to fictional, empty, pathetic, meaningless women, and guffawing over a disappointing assortment of wines about how the sequel better show a full-frontal of Big (unless the first film had it, I wouldn't know.  *shrug*)\n\nThe only thing more of a headache than Old Town Scottsdale is Old Money Scottsdale.\n\nSkip it unless you are an old broad or have future aspirations to become one.\n\nThe service sucks too.	0
First time at this place... and I don't think I will ever go back.  \n\nMusic was alright.  \n\nDRINKS WERE A RIP OFF.  I know it's Vegas but c'mon... a Redbull Vodka for $18... WTF?!  I bought the first round of drinks for my ladies... 1 water, 1 redbull vodka, and 1 gin tonic... $41!!!!  We drank our incredibly expensive drinks and peaced out!  I would have been REALLY mad if I had to pay to get into this place!	0
Paid 10.49 for unedible 2 taco plate which i threw  away. complained to staff and was offered something else which i declined but no refund. meat tasted very bitter and left bad taste in my mouth. It was truly horrible tasting. Worst mexican food I ever had this place is going on my NEVER again list. Go taco bell its better. Also there was very loud construction jackhammering  going on in the back which ruined the visit as well.	0
I usually don't leave reviews, but this was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. I called in for to-go two hours before they were going to close, I arrived 30 minutes later to pick up my food, note the fact that it took me around 25 minutes to get there, my boyfriend went in to pick up the order and the girl up front said she forgot to put it in and that it was too late to make sushi at that time. I won't be coming back.	0

Came here for Sunday Brunch and unfortunately I hate to say it but I wasn't impressed. Wynn is much better here especially for lunch. Paid $28 or so for Sunday brunch.\n\nI was expecting great things considering a lot of awesome reviews and also how beautiful and how well done the rest of the hotel was. However, the buffet was a dissapointment (well in comparison to all other buffets in Vegas). \n\nMy main gripe was selection was very limited. Also nothing really blew me away in terms of food.\n\nWould I go back? Not for lunch but maybe to try dinner.	0
"I bought a water heater from this company.  It did not heat the water.  When I called they sent another technician who told me \""""it wasn't installed correctly\""""\nA month later without my approval they charged my credit card $173.00 for the second visit to install it correctly.\nNicky said she would have the boss call me.  He did not.\nShe just charged my credit card without resolution, and without my authorization."	0
Sat in the bar area and enjoyed talking with the bartender and other patrons, the food however wasn't very good or memorable.	0
I'm really not sure what the hype is about this place. I went with a friend on a saturday night expecting good burgers or tacos, but they had an Indian theme that night. The appetizers were pretty bland, as were the main plates. I asked for some spicy sauce and the waitress looked offended, but it was the only thing that could help. Booths are also a bit tight.	0
Very disappointed. Stuck my feet in a bucket and walked away. Came back because the ion was beeping over and over again. Pulled my feet out after 15 minutes to stop the beeping. When she finally started my foot massage she was still working on someone else so she kept getting up and she even got up to put the music back on. I paid my money and walked out at 35 minutes. There were only four people working and the two that were finished before her and the lady that was working on my husband were in the back doing nothing.	0
