I was leery of trying a Peruvian restaurant in Arizona.  I still remember how much I enjoyed the food when traveling down there a couple of years ago and did not want to be disappointed.  Believe me, we were impressed.  \n\nWe had an appetizer and then a couple of dishes, which we shared to a certain extent.  My ceviche mixto was terrific.  \n\nThe service was extremely helpful.  I will definitely go back.	1
3 girls on Saturday night (early, maybe before 7 -- definitely still daylight)...  We came for a cocktail & to enjoy the fountains from a lounge experience.  Place had not turned 'clubby', was just a high end lounge.  Place is classy, view is great, servers are attentive (& beautiful), drinks are really not that pricey considering your location.\n\nCan't wait to go back, maybe even for late night experience.	1
We made a last minute reservation with Executive for our return to the airport from Treasure Island.  The $6 cost per person was a big savings over the $30 we paid for a taxi when we arrived and the least expensive of any of the shuttle services.  Our driver was extremely friendly, the coach was brand new and we were able to pay in cash when we boarded and didn't have to reserve with a credit card.  Plus, the driver used the back roads behind the casinos to avoid heavy traffic on the Strip.  We were totally impressed with the service and will use them again anytime we travel to Las Vegas.	1
Luv there chicken tacos, as long as they don't fry them to long. My boyfriend luvs the carne asada burritos. We also tried the rolled tacos, they weren't to good reminded me a lot of the frozen taquitos you would buy at the store.	1
The chocolate is very expensive but the cactus garden is an absolute MUST SEE around Christmas time.  It is amazingly beautiful and free!	1
We love Theresa, Mara, and everyone at JATC! They have shown love and affection for our dog Tuco, and treat him like own of their own. I have such peace of mind when I'm at work or out of town knowing he is in such good care. They also have taken care of him when he was sick, even washed and cleaned his towel and blankets. He has two homes now!	1
Delicious sushi! Lots of variety. Good drinks. Great for lunch and dinner! Full bar. Also they have coupons time to time on GroupOn. Would recommend.	1
Neither the name, location in front of the Fantastic Swap Meet nor physical appearance would suggest fine Chinese dining, but fine dining is what we enjoyed.  Unlike many Asian restaurants, service was both cheerful and attentive.  We shared orders of sauted shrimp coated with mayonnaise with honey walnuts, Singapore rice noodles and pea leaves with garlic.  The latter was not on the menu and relatively expensive at $11, but delicious.	1
Having been introduced to Chicken Katsu by a Hawaiian friend, I just can't get enough of this place.  The staff is always friendly and the food is made to order...not waiting around under heat lamps. I've tried other places and their recipes for Katsu, but have always been disappointed in the preparation (either cooked too much and dry, or too greasy and limp).  L&L has always been consistent.	1
St patty's day here was awesome! Live bands all day long, great food and fun atmosphere!	1
Really good food.  Actually some of the best Chinese/Sichuan I've had in the Midwest.  I stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend midday during the week and stopped back a few days later for carry out.  The interior is quite large and I can't imagine there would ever be much of a wait for a table.  Service was quick and friendly enough.  Prices were reasonable and we were both quite pleased with our meals - and looked forward to the leftovers.  I'll go back for sure.	1
Great place with light, filling dishes.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Angel Hair Tomato Basil was refreshing, flavorful, and fragrant.  Definitely will stop by here again on my next Vegas trip!	1
Very nice and relaxing atmosphere.  Pizza and garlic bread were very good.  312 on tap was nice.	1
I took my two nephews here for dinner before heading back to Texas.  I ordered the Oolong Sea Bass, which was stellar, as always.  One of my nephews got it too, and loved it.\n\nThe lettuce wraps were very good; however, the portions seem to have shrunk, as there wasn't much filling on the plate.  \n\nThe service was very, very good.	1
I've been here a few times now and I have one word for you, 2 Limit Margaritas!!! Okay, thats more than one word but you get the idea (: \n\nThe free chips and salsa are really tasty and come in a variety of sweet potato, tortilla and seasoned crispy fluffy ones... mmm. \n\nThe reason I gave 4 stars is because of the food. It's good but I felt it was missing something both times I ate there. \nI had the BBq burger and Portabello quesadilla which were a little bland and ordinary. \n\nIf your lookin' for a good, strong margarita though, this is the place!	1
Beautiful salon, very modern.  The owner and staff are amazing.  Randie hooked me up with beautiful blonde highlights.  She made me feel very comfortable right from the start.  I already booked my next appointment.  Thank you Randie and all the staff at The Parlor, you guys rock!!	1
I feel bad writing a one star review but come on! I went in today after wanting to try this place for forever. There was no line and nobody waiting. The lady in front of us ordered two bagels and we waited for probably ten minutes. Then someone came in and asked if they had started making the bagels they ordered 30 minutes ago(for 2 asiago bagels!), we already waited 10,so we just walked out. The service was way too slow! Hopefully next time I go it will be much faster and I can give this place a better review!	0
SCAM!!!\nTheir payment system is a scam. Do not sign anything! \nNot only the gym itself is probably the worst gym in Phoenix, but also they charge you hidden fees and charge you for 13 months a year.\nThey lost my credit card information and send my account to collections instead of correcting their own mistake. $40 bill went up to $300. When I told them it was their mistake, they got rude and told me they didn't care anymore and that I have to deal with the collection agency.	0
I'm not a poker player so this review is just about the look and feel of the Aria.  Boring.  It hardly feels like Vegas, more like a beige Californian suburb.  The slot machines also tend to block the view of the room.	0
Ordered delivery and it took 1hour and 30minutes to be delivered. The pizza was cold, charged me 5$ for delivery when the ad in the mail states 1.30$, not knowing I gave the driver a tip plus the $5 they charged me. When I called to check on my delivery the lady was grumpy and unpleasant. The pizza sucks, the hot wings suck they were sitting in grease not sauce, the only thing that I enjoyed was the soda! DON'T EAT HERE!!!!	0
Absolutely horrible! !! Waited 3 hours to see the doctor. The reception is ghetto and needs to find another job. No respect for their patients.  They make you wait 3 hours to see the doctor. Don't go!! Didn't want to pick a star but you have too.	0
I stopped in here for lunch. The food was just average and service was awful. They were very understaffed - it took about 10 minutes for the server to take my order, and then about another 40 minutes to get my food. I was in a bit of a rush, so ended up speed eating. \n\nI had a Greek salad, and it was just ok. Ingredients were fresh, but the chicken was pretty dry. \n\nNo bueno.	0
Be very careful purchasing jewelry here. Long delays in returning phone calls and emails. Also the salesperson changed the stone after we purchased(we only realized after it was delivered 4 weeks later). When the ring arrived it was missing a diamond and the sapphire had been changed out for a tourmaline. The store refused to refund the purchase, only offering to re-set the diamond. When taken to an independent appraiser(not a jeweler) the ring was worth 30% of what we paid. Very disappointed.	0
Most Starbucks have improved greatly where you can get quick and correct orders. \n\nThis airport location is right off the Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle 'gates'. So most folks hit it on the landing or exit to get their caffeine fix. \n\nIt is run by only two employees (in fairness, it is a small location so don't think more than 2 can fit without being on top of each other). \n\nThey do their best to move quickly but with just 1 person working while 1 takes orders - it can have long lines depending on what time you land.	0
The food there was okay. I had a salmon dish there. I don't eat beef so I can speak for their steak.	0
We bought cabinets from discount cabinets , poor service ,poor return phone calls ,damaged cabinets when arrived ,you get the total runaround ,this place is a big joke ,also you have to get what they build for sizes ,,if you want to get jacked around and lied to this is the place ,,you can buy from home depot or lowes  and get much better prices and better quality and much better service , discount cabinets is a  fly by night operation ,and ran very poor ,read other reviews and you will see what I am telling you , STAY CLEAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
Good food but terrible service. Wish their service was way better. Would only go if I had to because it's 24/7 and didn't care about service.	0
Not impressed. We ate here before the Celine concert since it was close and will not go back.  The margaritas were great, but you can keep the rest.  Average to below average food at best.	0
I agree with the posting that reported very high sodium and other not so good nutritional components to their meals. At first glance this seemed as if it would be a great, fast option to cooking, but not so. Expensive and usually not organic. Fruit with pesticides are not on my choice list.	0
Food was decent. Service was terrible. \n\nTook nearly 10 mins for them to bring out our drinks. 25 mins for our appetizer to come. 45 mins for our salads. We had to ask for utensils and napkins. Our main course didn't come our for over an hour and they got my order wrong. They never refilled our water...we always had to ask them to. \n\nThey didn't even begin to apologize until we expressed that we were displeased with the service. A nice lady from the kitchen did come out to apologize and gave us free dessert. However, free dessert does not excuse awful service. \n\nWill not be returning.	0
Worst customer service ever!!!! 30 minutes to get a money order at the money service desk! Really? ! Unacceptable! !! The lady was so unprofessional, she was not nice at all, didn't care about customers and was chewing gum with her mouth open all the time. Her name was Danielle.	0
"The scrambled eggs with croissant were good. Ambiance is non-existent. No french bakery feel at all. The products looked semi-appealing. Had a really hard time trying to find the damn place as it is hidden under a gargantuan office building. I would not by any means call this a \""""great\"""" french bakery."	0
