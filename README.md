# Dialogue for Prompting: A Policy-Gradient-Based Discrete Prompt Optimization for Few-shot Learning

This repository contains code for *Dialogue for Prompting: A Policy-Gradient-Based Discrete Prompt Optimization for Few-shot Learning* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07272, AAAI 2024) by Chengzhengxu Li, Xiaoming Liu, Yichen Wang, Duyi Li, Yu Lan, Chao Shen. In this codebase we provide DP2O, a novel discrete prompt optimization method for few-shot learning. DP2O significantly improves the performance of PLMs in various downstream tasks while ensuring prompt readability and transferability. In subsequent analysis , we also verify DP2Oâ€™s good universality, robustness, generalization ability, lightweight and efficiency.
